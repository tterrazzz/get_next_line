My version of the 42 project get_next_line, modified after 125 points project validation
________________________________________________________________________________________
Reads a file descriptor and returns a dynamically memory allocated array of char containing the next line, it must be freed by the user after use
Can be used to multiple times, until reaching the end of file, of course, each call would require to be freed after use
